title: First blog post
---

A blog sounds necessary to me and wants to maintain one. So this will be that place, I will be adding more entries here on most days. I have decided to start writing about whatever small software stuff I encounter at work, so please bear with me.

So this will be a programming blog, that being my favorite profession. And the reason why I want to maintain a blog is purely selfish and simple, I want to be better at what I do. One of the things a person can do to become good at something is to do research on it and writing forces you to do it. And that's exactly what I intend to do.

I use [Grammarly](grammarly.com) to fix my language, uses [Poole](getpoole.com)  as my base theme and uses [Github](https://github.com) for hosting.

I intend to change the blog title 'Just another blog' in the future. But for the time being, nothing comes to mind.
